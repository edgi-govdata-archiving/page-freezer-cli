# web-monitoring-ui

This repository is part of the EDGI [Web Monitoring Project](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring).

This component works with [web-monitoring-db](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-db) and [web-monitoring-processing](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-processing) to support the next web monitoring workflow.

A node application with the following capabilities:
* Page through records from Google spreadsheet and visualizes differences between URLs using pagefreezer cli
    * [DEMO](https://edgi-web-monitor-ui.herokuapp.com) is READ-ONLY
    * App pulls data from this [example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17QA_C2-XhLefxZlRKw74KDY3VNstbPvK3IHWluDJMGQ/edit#gid=0): 
    * Sheet mimics data that analysts use but added fields for urls seeded from these [examples](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-processing/tree/master/archives)

* These functions still available but hidden:
    * Take 2 URLs as input and visualize their differences
    * Take a formatted URL and return raw JSON from pagefreezer
    * Take a formatted URL and automatically display a diff

## Usage
* Install node dependencies with `npm install`, 
* Rename `dist/config.json.example` to `config.json` and supply google api_key and pagefreezer token (ask for token)
* [How to get api key](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/javascript/start/start-js)
* Run `node app.js`

## Manual view
Access the main view at `http://localhost:3000`

## URL Schemes
The new interface routes to:
`http://localhost:3000/diffbyindex`

With parameters:
`index` (required)

Main page `http://localhost:3000` redirects to  
`http://localhost:3000/diffbyindex?index=7` as first record

The old interface is hidden, but GET requests can still be made to:
`http://localhost:3000/diff`

With parameters:
`old_url` (required),
`new_url` (required),
`as` (optional can be `json` or `view`)

## Example
<http://localhost:3000/diff?old_url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-processing/master/archives/truepos-major-changes-a.html&new_url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-processing/master/archives/truepos-major-changes-b.html&as=view>

Automatically runs the diff and displays the output

See [the versionista outputter repo](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/versionista-outputter) and the [version tracking ui](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/version-tracking-ui) repos for earlier work that has some overlap/similar goals.
