# web-monitoring-ui

This repository is part of the EDGI [Web Monitoring Project](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring).

This component works with [web-monitoring-db](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-db) and [web-monitoring-processing](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-processing) to support the next web monitoring workflow.

It’s a React.js and Typescript-based browser application with a Node.js backend with the following capabilities:
* Consume subset of data from web-monitoring-db as proof of concept, read/write annotations
    * [DEMO](https://edgi-web-monitor-ui.herokuapp.com)
    * LIST VIEW shows first page of records from [web-monitor-db](https://web-monitoring-db.herokuapp.com/api/v0/pages) JSON endpoint
    * PAGE VIEW shows basic info about the latest version of that page: site, urls, and links to Versionista diffs
        * updates annotations
